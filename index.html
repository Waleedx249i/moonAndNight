    <h2>To zoon national park </h2>
    <p>Here, after nearly seven years, you are still here, a source of comfort and happiness, an exit door from the noise of the world, a safe place that I can visit whenever I want. They say “Things are never quite as scary when you’ve got a best friend” and I have one.</p>

<p>thay say "
    There are two things that grow more precious with age: old books to read, and old friends to enjoy."

    Every time our relationship grows longer, I am more simplified and more sure that I chose correctly, and with the passage of time and with all these memories, I feel that we are still at the beginning and that we are waiting for long paths to walk, stories to tell and adventures to live</p>
    <h2>why this website ? </h2>
    <p>Because nothing is perfect for me except that you are part of itso I decided to add this website to our memory box...and😂 Yes sir, it is impossible to do something and not get you into it, my experiment mouse</p>
    <h2>shine on until tomorrow</h2>
    <p>I solemnly swear to be faithful to my friend, for as long as the sun and moon shall endure.</p>
